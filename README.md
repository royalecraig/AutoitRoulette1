;A Roulette simulation to try our various strategies on outside table bets


;A roullete simulation or player that can be used to 'simulate' the spins of roulette
;with the user betting on outside bets eg, Red or Black, 1st Doz, 2nd Doz etc.

;Needs more Tool tips and a few other bits, but seems to work pretty 
;well and should be largely self explanatory.
;An on going project.
